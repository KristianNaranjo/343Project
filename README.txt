Project Part 1

Intro:
This is the first part of our VCS (Version Control System) project. It only implements an initial usecase:
Create Repo. It also makes a number of simplifying assumptions in order to get to working S/W
quickly.

External Requirements:
You must first have java installed on your computer. You must also have access to an IDE(integrated
development environment) such as Eclipse. 

Build - 1.0

Installation :
To install, open your Java IDE. Then, import the project folder into
your workspace by clicking File -> Import -> Import existing project into workspace.
Then find the project folder called 343Project and select import.

Setup:
Once the project has been imported, you may open it any time from the IDE by clicking
File -> Open Project. Then find the project named 343Project. Once opened, you may run it
by pressing the run button.

Usage:
To use this program you must enter a command and a set of arguments, similar to a command line.
In order to create a repository, type "create repo", then type in the name of the source folder
that is the project tree(In this case you can use mypt or mypt2). Then enter the destination
for the repo to be created. An example of this input would be "create repo mypt ./"

Extra Features:
You may enter exit at any time to leave the command line.

Bugs: n/a for this use case
